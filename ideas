How about a spaceman, marooned on a moon-like surface, side scrolling slowly from left to right - picking up detritus from the crash as he goes.
Alone, in the sense that he is marooned and there are humans left around him - does this mean we can have enemies?
Hmm, that would make it no different to any other game where you have enemies..


How about shipwreck? Nope

Okay, puzzle game, you are in a room full of people. OH SNAP.
You don't know how to talk to them
You feel alone

The goal is to make friends with people by listening to their conversations, and then taking the pieces
of information you have learned off each person to other people in the room and using them to make conversation.
Conversations will be indicated by the use of shapes in speech bubbles

Will this be compelling? Perhaps you speak to people and it somehow triggers a subgame (the real game) which is a game which depending on how well you do gives you abilities in future plays of that subgame.

Music will be a few pieces of guitar, simple notes in the background for ambience.
Sound effects will be sfxr
